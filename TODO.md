# TODO: Update Course Dropdown in Lecturer Rating Tab

## Tasks
- [ ] Modify the course selection dropdown in the lecturer rating form to populate with all courses from the courses table instead of lecturer-specific courses.
- [ ] Format course options as "course_code - course_name" to match existing logic.
- [ ] Ensure selectedCourse state works correctly with the new options.

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Test the rating form to verify courses appear in dropdown.
- [ ] Check that rating submission still works with the new course selection.
