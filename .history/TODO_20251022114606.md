# Task: Remove Add Class Functionality in Lecturer Dashboard

## Steps to Complete:
1. Remove the "+ Add New Class" button from the Classes tab header in lecturer.js
2. Remove the entire "Add Class Tab" section (the form for adding new classes) from lecturer.js
3. Remove the "Edit" and "Delete" buttons from the classes table in lecturer.js
4. Change the fetchClasses function to filter classes created by the principal lecturer instead of the current user
5. Add a function to fetch the principal lecturer's details
6. Add a "View" button to the classes table that opens a modal with full class details
7. Update the classes tab to allow lecturers to only view classes created by the principal lecturer

## Additional Notes:
- Ensure the lecturer can view full details of the class in a modal
- If needed, update the principal lecturer's add class form to include lecturer name field (but this may be separate)
